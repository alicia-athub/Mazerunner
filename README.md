# Mazerunner
Program to find your way out of the maze
Goal: to find your way out of the maze with only 200 moves to make( same number of lives), before you die.
Your options are to move 'north', 'south', 'east', or 'west'. Each maze is a 20x20 grid, with 'X's representing the walls and ' ' representing a clear path. Every time a new maze is created, you are placed randomly in the maze, with only one exit to find.
